<p></p><h3>Minimal Circuit (Eliminating the External Clock)</h3>
<p>If you don't have the extra 16 <span>MHz</span> crystal and 18-22 picofarad capacitors used in the above examples, you can configure the <span class="wikiword">ATmega328</span> to use its internal 8 <span class="wikiword">MHz</span> RC oscillator as a clock source instead.  (You don't really need the 10K pullup resistor on the reset pin either, so we remove it to get a truly minimal configuration.)
</p>
<p></p><p>You'll need to install support for an additional hardware configuration:
</p><ol><li>Download this hardware configuration archive: <a href="Breadboard.zip" rel="nofollow">Breadboard.zip</a>
</li><li>Create a "hardware" sub-folder in your Arduino sketchbook folder (whose location you can find in the Arduino preferences dialog).  If you've previously installed support for additional hardware configuration, you may already have a "hardware" folder in your sketchbook.
</li><li>Move the "breadboard" folder from the zip archive to the "hardware" sub-folder of your Arduino sketchbook.
</li><li>Restart the Arduino software.
</li><li>You should see "<span>ATmega328</span> on a breadboard (8 <span class="wikiword">MHz</span> internal clock)" in the Tools &gt; Board menu.
</li></ol><p></p><p>Once you've done this, you can burn the bootloader and upload programs onto your <span class="wikiword">ATmega328</span> as described above.  <strong>Be sure to select "<span class="wikiword">ATmega328</span> on a breadboard (8 <span class="wikiword">MHz</span> internal clock)" when burning the bootloader.</strong> (If you select the wrong item and configure the microcontroller to use an external clock, it won't work unless you connect one.)

<p></p><h3>Getting Rid of the Arduino Board</h3>
<p>Once you've programmed the <span>ATmega</span> on the breadboard, you can eliminate the Arduino.  To do so, you'll need to provide an alternative power supply for the microcontroller.  See the <a class="wikilink" href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Standalone">standalone Arduino on a breadboard</a> tutorial for details.
